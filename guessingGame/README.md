# Guessing Game

This fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer and involves the following steps:

1. The system generates a random secret number from a given range, say 1 to 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter their guess number in a displayed dialogue box.
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches or is higher/lower than the secret number.
4. The game continues until the user guesses the secret number.
