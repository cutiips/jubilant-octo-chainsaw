# Shark Census Management Application

## Description

This application is used to manage shark census data. It uses XML files to store and retrieve information on individual sharks, their biological classification, physical characteristics and threat levels. The data also includes information on shark habitats. Here's a quick look at an extract from an XML file (which has been validated by the XSD schema in the Oracle database).
